                <text id="rightText">
                    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
                        Comics. The character was co-created by
                        writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck
                        and
                        Jack Kirby. The
                        character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and
                        received
                        his own title in
                        Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor,
                        Ant-Man,
                        Wasp and the Hulk.</p>

                    <p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
                        Anthony Edward Stark
                        suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to
                        build a
                        weapon of mass
                        destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape
                        captivity.
                        Later, Stark develops
                        his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
                        Industries.</p>
                    <p>He uses the
                        suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his
                        true
                        identity, Stark
                        eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.

                        Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role
                        of
                        American technology
                        and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have
                        transitioned
                        from Cold War motifs
                        to contemporary matters of the time.</p>


                    Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the
                    superhero team the
                    Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron
                    Man has been adapted
                    for several animated television shows and films.

                    <p>Wolverine (birth name: James Howlett;[1] alias: Logan and Weapon X) is a fictional
                        character appearing in American comic
                        books published by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who
                        possesses
                        animal-keen senses,
                        enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, and
                        three
                        retractable claws
                        in each hand. Wolverine has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, X-Force, Alpha
                        Flight,
                        the Fantastic Four,
                        and the Avengers.</p>
                    <p>
                        The character appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before having a larger role
                        in
                        #181 (cover-dated
                        November 1974). He was created by Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas,[2] writer Len Wein,[3] and
                        Marvel art director John
                        Romita Sr. Romita designed the character's costume, but the character was first drawn for
                        publication by Herb Trimpe.</p>
                    <p>
                        Wolverine then joined a revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men, where eventually
                        writer
                        Chris Claremont,
                        artist Dave Cockrum, and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the
                        character's
                        development. Artist
                        Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped revise the character with a four-part
                        eponymous
                        limited series from
                        September to December 1982, which debuted Wolverine's catchphrase, "I'm the best there is at
                        what I
                        do, but what I do
                        best isn't very nice."</p>

                    Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the
                    Vietnam
                    War;[4]: 265  his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding loner nature became standard
                    characteristics for
                    comic book antiheroes by the end of the 1980s.[4]: 277  As a result, the character became a fan
                    favorite of the
                    increasingly popular X-Men franchise,[4]: 263, 265  and has been featured in his own solo Wolverine
                    comic book series
                    since 1988.

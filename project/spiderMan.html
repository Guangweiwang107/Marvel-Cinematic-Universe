                        Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created
                        by
                        writer-editor Stan
                        Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15
                        (August 1962) in the
                        Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television shows, novels, video
                        games, and plays.</p>
                    <p>
                        Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New
                        York
                        City after his
                        parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with
                        the
                        struggles of
                        adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
                        Thompson, J.
                        Jonah Jameson, and
                        Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such
                        as
                        Doctor Octopus, the
                        Green Goblin, and Venom.</p> In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and
                    abilities
                    from a bite from a
                    radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and
                    agility, and
                    detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted
                    "web-shooter" devices
                    that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that was meant to be used for shooting and
                    trapping his enemies, and
                    web-swinging across the city. After the personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using
                    his spider-powers to
                    fight against crime as Spider-Man.
                    <p>
                        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were
                        usually
                        relegated to the role
                        of sidekick to the protagonist. </p>

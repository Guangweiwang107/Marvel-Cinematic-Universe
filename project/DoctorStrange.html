                    <p> Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a 2022 American superhero film based
                        on Marvel Comics featuring the
                        character Doctor Strange. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios
                        Motion
                        Pictures, it is the
                        sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and the 28th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). </p>
                    <p>The film
                        was directed by Sam
                        Raimi, written by Michael Waldron, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, alongside
                        Elizabeth Olsen,
                        Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Rachel McAdams. In the
                        film,
                        Strange protects
                        America Chavez (Gomez), a teenager capable of traveling the multiverse, from Wanda Maximoff
                        (Olsen).</p>
                    <p>
                        Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a sequel by October 2016.
                        He
                        signed to return as
                        director in December 2018, when Cumberbatch was confirmed to return. The film's title was
                        announced
                        in July 2019 along
                        with Olsen's involvement, while Jade Halley Bartlett was hired to write the film that October.

                    <p>
                        Derrickson stepped down
                        as director in January 2020, citing creative differences. Waldron and Raimi joined the following
                        month and started over,
                        adding elements of the horror genre that Raimi had worked with previously and making Maximoff
                        the
                        villain of the film,
                        continuing her story from the series WandaVision (2021). Filming began in November 2020 in
                        London
                        but was put on hold in
                        January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed by March 2021 and concluded in
                        mid-April in Somerset.
                        Shooting also occurred in Surrey and Los Angeles.</p>

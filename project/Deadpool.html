                    <p> Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of
                        the same name. Distributed by 20th
                        Century Fox, it is a spin-off in the X-Men film series and the eighth installment overall.
                        Directed
                        by Tim Miller (in
                        his feature directorial debut) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, it stars Ryan
                        Reynolds
                        in the title role
                        alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. In the
                        film, Wade Wilson hunts
                        the man who gave him mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the antihero
                        Deadpool.</p>
                    <p>
                        Development of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, before he played the
                        character in X-Men
                        Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Reese and Wernick were hired for a spinoff in 2010 and worked with
                        Reynolds to adapt the
                        character more faithfully (including his fourth wall breaking) after the portrayal in Wolverine
                        was
                        criticized. </p>
                    <p> Miller
                        was hired in 2011, marking his directorial debut. An enthusiastic response to leaked test
                        footage he
                        created with
                        Reynolds led to a green-light from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began in early 2015, and
                        filming
                        took place in
                        Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May of that year. Several vendors provided visual
                        effects
                        for the film,
                        ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CG character Colossus.</p>
                    <p>
                        Deadpool was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an unconventional
                        marketing
                        campaign. The film
                        achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $782 million against a $58 million
                        budget, becoming the
                        ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the
                        highest-grossing
                        R-rated film at the
                        time.</p>

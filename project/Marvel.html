                <text id="rightText"><p>By 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films
                    independently and distribute them through
                    Paramount Pictures.[2] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia
                    Pictures, New Line
                    Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox.</p> <p> Marvel made
                    relatively little
                    profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films
                    while maintaining
                    artistic control of the projects and distribution.[4] Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was
                    pleased with Sam
                    Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony Pictures, but was less pleased with others. As a result, Arad
                    decided to form Marvel
                    Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks.</p> <p> Kevin Feige, Arad's
                    second-in-command,[5]
                    realized that unlike Spider-Man and the X-Men, whose film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox,
                    respectively, Marvel
                    still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers. Feige, a self-described "fanboy",
                    envisioned creating a
                    shared universe, just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the
                    early 1960s.</p>
<p>
                    To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit
                    facility with Merrill
                    Lynch.[4] Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge
                    them in a crossover
                    film.[7] Arad doubted the strategy, but insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the
                    initial financing. </p>He
                    resigned the following year.[5][8] In 2007, at 33 years old, Feige was named studio chief. In order
                    to preserve its
                    artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic
                    book lore.</text>

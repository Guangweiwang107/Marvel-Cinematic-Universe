                <text id="rightText">
                    <p>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                        writer Stan Lee and
                        artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May
                        1962).</p>
                    <p> In his comic book
                        appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily
                        represented by the alter ego
                        Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical
                        strength, and the alter
                        ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved
                        physicist, both of whom
                        typically resent each other.</p>
                    <p>
                        Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the
                        detonation of an
                        experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional
                        stress, at or against his
                        will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to conflicts that complicate
                        Banner's civilian life.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger.
                        Commonly portrayed as a raging
                        savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a mindless, destructive force
                        (War), to a brilliant
                        warrior (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil/Immortal), a genius scientist in his
                        own right (Doc Green),
                        and a gangster (Joe Fixit). It is later revealed Banner's DID formed from being abused by his
                        father Brian as a child
                        and that the alter egos known as Fixit and the Devil/Immortal Hulk originally manifested during
                        his childhood, with a
                        malevolent identity embodying his guilt, shame, and regret towards his father (based on him)
                        manifesting as the Guilt.</p>

                <text id="rightText">
                    <p> Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
                        Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe
                        Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated
                        March
                        1941) from Timely
                        Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier
                        who
                        often fought the
                        Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime
                        period.</p>
                    <p>
                        The popularity of
                        superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in
                        1950,
                        with a short-lived
                        revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained
                        in
                        publication.</p>
                    <p>
                        The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a
                        nearly-indestructible shield that he
                        throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young artist
                        enhanced to the peak of
                        human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the military to aid the
                        United States
                        government's efforts in World War II.</p> Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and
                    survived in
                    suspended animation
                    until he was revived in modern times. <p> Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his
                        ideals as a man out of
                        his time, he remains a highly respected figure both with the American public and in the
                        superhero
                        community, which
                        includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.</p>

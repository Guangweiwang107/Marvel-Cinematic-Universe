                    <p> Venom is a 2018 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of
                        the same name, produced by Columbia
                        Pictures in association with Marvel[5] and Tencent Pictures, and distributed by Sony Pictures
                        Releasing. It is the first
                        film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) and is directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay by
                        Jeff Pinkner, Scott
                        Rosenberg, and Kelly Marcel.</p>
                    <p> It stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom alongside Michelle
                        Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott
                        Haze, and Reid Scott. In the film, struggling journalist Brock gains superpowers after becoming
                        the
                        host of an alien
                        symbiote, Venom, whose species plans to invade Earth.

                        After Venom's appearance in Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony attempted to develop a spin-off film based
                        on
                        the character but it
                        did not move forward due to issues with Sony's ongoing Spider-Man franchise.</p>
                    <p>In March 2016, work
                        began on a new version
                        that would start a new shared universe featuring the non-Spider-Man Marvel characters that the
                        studio possessed film
                        rights to. Sony also intended for Venom to share the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's
                        Spider-Man: Homecoming
                        (2017), but ultimately distanced the film from Spider-Man. In March 2017, Rosenberg and Pinkner
                        were
                        set to write, with
                        Fleischer and Hardy added in May. Filming took place from October 2017 to January 2018 in
                        Atlanta,
                        New York City, and
                        San Francisco. The film was primarily inspired by the comic book miniseries Venom: Lethal
                        Protector
                        (1993) and the story
                        arc "Planet of the Symbiotes" (1995).</p>
                    <p>
                        Venom premiered at Regency Village Theater on October 1, 2018, and was theatrically released in
                        the
                        United States on
                        October 5, 2018. The film received generally negative reviews from critics for its narrative,
                        inconsistent tone, and
                        lack of a stronger connection to its source material, while Hardy's performance received mixed
                        reviews.</p>
